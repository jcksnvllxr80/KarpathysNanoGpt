# Karpathy's Nano GPT

This repo is my code-space while learning about generative AI with [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/)
from his Youtube video lecture [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY).
His repo from the video: [github](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).
